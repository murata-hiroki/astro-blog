    My Astro Learning Blog
    <p>This is where I will post about my journey learning Astro.</p>

    <p>
      I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second
      page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
    </p>
    <ul>
      {
        allPosts.map((post) => (
          <BlogPost url={post.url} title={post.frontmatter.title} />
        ))
      }
    </ul>
  </h1>
  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
  </p>
